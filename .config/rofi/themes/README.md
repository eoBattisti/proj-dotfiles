### Installing themes

Clone this repository and change to its directory:
If you don't have the directories needed for the install create them with:

`mkdir -p ~/.local/share/rofi/themes/`
Copy your desired theme to ~/.local/share/rofi/themes folder:
`cp themes/<your-selected-theme> ~/.local/share/rofi/themes/ `

Run Rofi in run mode, then run rofi-theme-selector.

Search for your desired theme, press enter to preview, then Alt+a to accept the new theme.

Enjoy your new Rofi theme!
